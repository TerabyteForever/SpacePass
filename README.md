# SpacePass
A password "engine" for C++ developers to use in their apps.

Currently, It can encrypt and decrypt a very basic algorithm. Adding Base64 support is on my TODO list.

# Cross platform support

SpacePass is a cross-platform engine. It can run on any operating system that supports C++ Standard Library.
